# Contributing to yt-dlp-wizwam

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project aims to provide a polished, easy-to-install wrapper around [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) with both CLI and web interfaces. Contributions of all kinds are welcomeâ€”from bug reports and documentation fixes to new features.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [maintainer@wizwam.com](mailto:maintainer@wizwam.com).

## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork locally.
2. **Create a virtual environment** (Python 3.10+):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
3. **Run the test suite** (when available):
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/short-description
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Write code following [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines.
2. Add or update tests where appropriate.
3. Update documentation (README, CHANGELOG) when changing user-facing behavior.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (`pytest`).
5. If adding dependencies, make sure they are recorded in `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.
6. Commit using clear, descriptive messages (see **Commit Guidelines** below).
7. Push to your fork and open a pull request against `main`.

## Commit Guidelines

- Use the conventional commit style when possible:
  - `feat: add new macro runner`
  - `fix: handle multi-stream progress`
  - `chore: update dependencies`
- Keep commits focusedâ€”one logical change per commit.
- Reference issues with `Fixes #123` when applicable.

- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
